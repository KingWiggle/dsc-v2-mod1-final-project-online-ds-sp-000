## General Info
The repository contains my efforts in modeling sale prices for homes in King County, Washington.  I built prediction models by training them on a database containing approximately 20k records with each documenting the sale of a home during 2014-2015.  The models performed fairly with a lot of room for improvement in regards to accuracy and model assumptions.  

## The Process 
![Data Science Process](./img/Mod2Process.png)

This project can be broken down into six steps. I imported the data from the source database and inspected its characteristics. Next, I cleaned and explored before I prepared the data for modeling.  Lastly, I fit the models on the features and evaluate their performances.
